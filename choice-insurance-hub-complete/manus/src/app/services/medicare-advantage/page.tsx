                Medicare Advantage Plans, also known as Medicare Part C, are all-in-one alternatives to Original Medicare. 
                Offered by private insurance companies approved by Medicare, these plans combine hospital (Part A) and 
                medical (Part B) coverage and often include additional benefits like prescription drug coverage, dental, 
                vision, and wellness programs.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-deep-forest-green font-poppins mt-8">How Medicare Advantage Works</h2>
              <p>
                Medicare Advantage Plans are built on a cost-sharing model. While they often come with lower monthly 
                premiums than Medicare Supplement Plans, you may be responsible for certain out-of-pocket costs such 
                as copayments, coinsurance, and annual deductibles when receiving care. These plans typically use 
                provider networks (like HMOs or PPOs), so understanding your network and coverage limits is key.
