      <p className="mb-6">As we progress through 2025, the health insurance landscape continues to undergo transformative changes that are reshaping how Americans access, experience, and pay for healthcare coverage. These developments represent the culmination of years of policy evolution, technological advancement, and shifting consumer expectations that are fundamentally altering the relationship between patients, providers, and insurers. At Choice Insurance Hub, we recognize that staying informed about these changes is crucial for making informed decisions about your health insurance coverage and ensuring that you can take full advantage of new benefits and opportunities while navigating potential challenges and limitations.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-6">The health insurance industry in 2025 is characterized by unprecedented innovation, expanded access to care, enhanced consumer protections, and a growing emphasis on preventive care and wellness. These changes are being driven by a combination of federal and state policy initiatives, technological breakthroughs, changing demographics, and lessons learned from recent public health challenges. Understanding these trends and their implications can help you make more informed decisions about your health insurance coverage and healthcare utilization while positioning yourself to benefit from new opportunities and protections.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Telehealth Revolution: Permanent Integration into Healthcare Delivery</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-6">Perhaps no aspect of healthcare has been more dramatically transformed in recent years than the delivery of medical services through telehealth platforms, and 2025 represents a watershed moment in the permanent integration of these technologies into mainstream healthcare delivery. What began as an emergency response to public health challenges has evolved into a sophisticated, comprehensive approach to healthcare that is fundamentally changing how patients access care and how providers deliver services.</p>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Expanded Coverage and Parity Requirements</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">The most significant development in telehealth coverage for 2025 is the widespread implementation of telehealth parity laws that require health insurance plans to cover telehealth services at the same cost-sharing level as equivalent in-person services. This means that if your health plan covers an office visit with a $25 copayment, a telehealth consultation for the same type of service must also be available with a $25 copayment, eliminating the cost barriers that previously limited telehealth adoption.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">These parity requirements extend beyond simple video consultations to include a broad range of telehealth services including remote patient monitoring, store-and-forward technologies for sharing medical images and data, and mobile health applications that provide clinical decision support. Health insurance plans are now required to cover these services when they are medically appropriate and provided by qualified healthcare professionals, creating new opportunities for convenient and cost-effective care delivery.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">The expansion of telehealth coverage has been particularly beneficial for individuals living in rural or underserved areas where access to specialists and certain types of medical care has traditionally been limited. Telehealth services can now connect patients with specialists located hundreds of miles away, providing access to expertise that would otherwise require extensive travel and time away from work or family responsibilities.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Mental health services have seen particularly dramatic expansion through telehealth platforms, with most health insurance plans now covering teletherapy, psychiatric consultations, and digital mental health programs at the same cost-sharing levels as in-person services. This expansion has helped address the significant shortage of mental health providers in many areas and has made mental health care more accessible and convenient for millions of Americans.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Integration with Artificial Intelligence and Digital Health Tools</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">The telehealth landscape in 2025 is increasingly sophisticated, incorporating artificial intelligence, machine learning, and advanced digital health tools that enhance the quality and effectiveness of remote care delivery. AI-powered diagnostic tools can now assist healthcare providers in analyzing symptoms, reviewing medical images, and making clinical decisions during telehealth consultations, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment recommendations.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Remote patient monitoring technologies have become more advanced and widely covered by health insurance plans, allowing patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease to be continuously monitored from their homes. These systems can automatically transmit vital signs, blood glucose levels, blood pressure readings, and other health data to healthcare providers, enabling proactive intervention and reducing the need for emergency room visits and hospitalizations.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Digital therapeutics, which are evidence-based software programs designed to treat medical conditions, are increasingly being covered by health insurance plans as legitimate medical treatments. These programs can provide cognitive behavioral therapy for mental health conditions, medication adherence support for chronic diseases, and lifestyle modification programs for conditions such as diabetes and obesity.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Preventive Care Enhancement: Expanding the Foundation of Wellness</h2>

      <div className="relative w-full h-[400px] my-6">
        <Image 
          src="/images/blog/preventive-care-expansion-2025.jpg" 
          alt="Healthcare provider conducting comprehensive preventive care screening with patient" 
          fill
          className="object-cover rounded-lg"
        />
      </div>

      <p className="mb-6">The emphasis on preventive care has reached new heights in 2025, with health insurance plans significantly expanding their coverage of preventive services and wellness programs. This shift reflects a growing recognition that investing in prevention and early detection can improve health outcomes while reducing long-term healthcare costs for both individuals and the healthcare system as a whole.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Expanded Preventive Services Coverage</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">Health insurance plans in 2025 are required to cover an expanded list of preventive services without cost-sharing, meaning these services are available to plan members at no additional cost beyond their monthly premiums. The expanded list includes new cancer screening technologies, advanced cardiovascular risk assessments, comprehensive mental health screenings, and innovative diagnostic tests that can detect diseases in their earliest stages when treatment is most effective.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Genetic testing for hereditary cancer syndromes and other genetic conditions is now widely covered as a preventive service for individuals who meet specific risk criteria. This coverage allows individuals with family histories of certain cancers or genetic conditions to undergo testing that can inform their healthcare decisions and enable early intervention strategies that can significantly improve outcomes.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Annual wellness visits have been enhanced to include more comprehensive health assessments, including cognitive function screening, fall risk assessments for older adults, and detailed lifestyle counseling that addresses nutrition, physical activity, stress management, and other factors that influence health outcomes. These enhanced wellness visits are designed to identify health risks early and provide personalized recommendations for maintaining and improving health.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Preventive care coverage has also been expanded to include services that address social determinants of health, such as nutrition counseling, smoking cessation programs, and substance abuse screening and brief intervention services. These services recognize that health outcomes are influenced by factors beyond traditional medical care and that addressing these broader determinants can have significant impacts on overall health and well-being.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Wellness Programs and Incentive Structures</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">Health insurance plans in 2025 have significantly expanded their wellness programs and incentive structures, offering more sophisticated and personalized approaches to encouraging healthy behaviors and lifestyle modifications. These programs often include financial incentives such as premium discounts, reduced deductibles, or cash rewards for participating in wellness activities and achieving specific health goals.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Biometric screening programs have become more comprehensive and are often integrated with digital health platforms that provide ongoing monitoring and feedback. Participants can track their progress toward health goals, receive personalized recommendations for improvement, and access educational resources and support programs that help them maintain healthy behaviors over time.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Workplace wellness programs have evolved to include more sophisticated approaches to employee health and well-being, including stress management programs, ergonomic assessments, mental health support services, and comprehensive health coaching programs. These programs are often integrated with health insurance benefits to provide seamless access to wellness resources and support services.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Prescription Drug Cost Reforms: Addressing Affordability and Access</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">Prescription drug costs have been a major concern for consumers and policymakers for years, and 2025 has brought significant reforms designed to improve affordability and access to necessary medications. These changes represent the most comprehensive approach to prescription drug cost control in decades and are having meaningful impacts on out-of-pocket costs for millions of Americans.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Medicare Prescription Drug Reforms</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">The Medicare prescription drug program has undergone substantial reforms in 2025, including the implementation of annual out-of-pocket caps that limit the amount beneficiaries pay for prescription drugs each year. This cap provides significant protection against catastrophic prescription drug costs and ensures that Medicare beneficiaries will not face unlimited out-of-pocket expenses for their medications.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Medicare has also implemented new negotiation authority that allows the program to negotiate prices for certain high-cost prescription drugs, potentially resulting in lower costs for both the Medicare program and beneficiaries. These negotiations focus on drugs that represent the highest costs to the Medicare program and for which there are limited generic or biosimilar alternatives.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">The Medicare prescription drug program has also enhanced its coverage of biosimilar medications, which are highly similar versions of expensive biologic drugs that can provide the same therapeutic benefits at significantly lower costs. Health plans are now required to provide preferential coverage for biosimilar medications when they are available and clinically appropriate.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Commercial Insurance Drug Coverage Improvements</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">Commercial health insurance plans have also implemented significant improvements to prescription drug coverage, including enhanced transparency requirements that provide consumers with better information about drug costs and coverage decisions. Plans are now required to provide clear, accessible information about their formularies, prior authorization requirements, and appeals processes.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Many health insurance plans have expanded their coverage of specialty medications and have implemented new programs to help patients access expensive medications through patient assistance programs, manufacturer discounts, and alternative funding sources. These programs can significantly reduce out-of-pocket costs for patients who need expensive specialty medications for conditions such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and rare genetic disorders.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Prescription drug formularies have become more dynamic, with plans able to add new generic medications and remove brand-name drugs more quickly when cost-effective alternatives become available. This flexibility allows plans to provide better value to their members while maintaining access to necessary medications.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Mental Health Coverage Revolution: Achieving True Parity and Access</h2>

      <div className="relative w-full h-[400px] my-6">
        <Image 
          src="/images/blog/mental-health-coverage-2025.jpg" 
          alt="Mental health professional providing teletherapy session to patient" 
          fill
          className="object-cover rounded-lg"
        />
      </div>

      <p className="mb-6">Mental health coverage has undergone a revolutionary transformation in 2025, with new regulations, expanded access, and innovative treatment approaches that are making mental health care more accessible, affordable, and effective than ever before. These changes represent a fundamental shift in how the healthcare system approaches mental health and recognize mental health as an essential component of overall health and well-being.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Enhanced Parity Enforcement and Coverage Requirements</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">Mental health parity laws have been significantly strengthened in 2025, with enhanced enforcement mechanisms and more specific requirements for how health insurance plans must provide mental health and substance abuse coverage. Plans are now required to demonstrate that their mental health benefits are truly equivalent to their medical and surgical benefits in terms of cost-sharing, treatment limitations, and access to care.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">The enhanced parity requirements include specific provisions for network adequacy, ensuring that health plans maintain sufficient numbers of mental health providers to meet the needs of their members. Plans must demonstrate that appointment wait times for mental health services are comparable to wait times for other medical services and that their provider networks include adequate geographic distribution and specialty coverage.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Prior authorization requirements for mental health services have been significantly restricted, with plans prohibited from imposing more stringent prior authorization requirements for mental health services than they impose for comparable medical services. This change has reduced barriers to accessing mental health care and has eliminated many of the administrative hurdles that previously delayed or prevented treatment.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Innovative Treatment Approaches and Digital Mental Health</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">The mental health landscape in 2025 includes a wide range of innovative treatment approaches that are now covered by health insurance plans, including digital therapeutics, virtual reality therapy, and AI-powered mental health applications. These new treatment modalities provide additional options for individuals seeking mental health care and can be particularly effective for certain conditions and populations.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Peer support services have been expanded and are now covered by many health insurance plans as evidence-based interventions that can complement traditional mental health treatment. These services connect individuals with mental health conditions with trained peer specialists who have lived experience with similar challenges and can provide support, encouragement, and practical guidance for recovery and wellness.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Integrated care models that combine mental health services with primary care have become more widespread and are increasingly supported by health insurance coverage structures that recognize the value of coordinated care. These models can improve outcomes while reducing costs by addressing mental health concerns in primary care settings and ensuring that mental health considerations are integrated into overall healthcare planning.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Health Insurance Marketplace Innovations: Enhanced Choice and Consumer Protection</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">The health insurance marketplace has continued to evolve in 2025, with new innovations designed to improve consumer choice, enhance transparency, and provide better value for individuals and families purchasing health insurance coverage. These changes reflect ongoing efforts to make health insurance more accessible, understandable, and responsive to consumer needs.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Enhanced Plan Comparison Tools and Transparency</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">Health insurance marketplaces have implemented sophisticated new tools that make it easier for consumers to compare health insurance plans and understand their coverage options. These tools provide detailed cost estimates based on individual health needs and medication requirements, allowing consumers to make more informed decisions about which plan will provide the best value for their specific circumstances.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Price transparency requirements have been expanded to include more detailed information about provider costs, prescription drug prices, and out-of-network charges. Consumers can now access real-time information about the cost of medical services and procedures, allowing them to make more informed decisions about where to receive care and how to manage their healthcare expenses.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Quality ratings and performance measures for health insurance plans have been enhanced to provide consumers with better information about plan performance in areas such as customer satisfaction, clinical quality, and access to care. These ratings help consumers evaluate plans based on factors beyond just cost and can guide them toward plans that provide better overall value and experience.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Expanded Subsidies and Affordability Programs</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">Premium subsidies and cost-sharing reductions have been expanded in 2025 to make health insurance more affordable for middle-income individuals and families who previously did not qualify for assistance. These expanded subsidies have made marketplace coverage more accessible to a broader range of consumers and have helped reduce the number of uninsured Americans.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Special enrollment periods have been expanded to provide more opportunities for individuals to enroll in health insurance coverage outside of the annual open enrollment period. These expanded opportunities include new qualifying life events and extended enrollment periods that make it easier for individuals to obtain coverage when their circumstances change.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Navigator and enrollment assistance programs have been enhanced to provide more comprehensive support for consumers who need help understanding their health insurance options and enrolling in coverage. These programs include multilingual support, specialized assistance for individuals with complex health needs, and ongoing support throughout the plan year.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Technology Integration and Digital Health Innovation</h2>

      <div className="relative w-full h-[400px] my-6">
        <Image 
          src="/images/blog/digital-health-innovation-2025.jpg" 
          alt="Patient using digital health app with wearable device for health monitoring" 
          fill
          className="object-cover rounded-lg"
        />
      </div>

      <p className="mb-6">The integration of technology into health insurance and healthcare delivery has accelerated dramatically in 2025, with new digital tools and platforms that are transforming how consumers interact with their health insurance coverage and access healthcare services. These technological innovations are making healthcare more convenient, personalized, and effective while providing new opportunities for prevention and early intervention.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Wearable Technology and Health Monitoring Integration</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">Health insurance plans have increasingly integrated wearable technology and health monitoring devices into their coverage and wellness programs, providing members with access to devices that can track physical activity, monitor vital signs, and provide real-time health data. Many plans now offer free or discounted fitness trackers, smartwatches, and other wearable devices as part of their wellness programs.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">The data collected from these devices is being used to provide personalized health recommendations, identify potential health risks, and reward healthy behaviors through premium discounts and other incentives. Advanced analytics can identify patterns in health data that may indicate developing health problems, allowing for early intervention and prevention strategies.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Remote patient monitoring programs have been expanded to include a wider range of chronic conditions and health concerns, with health insurance plans covering the cost of monitoring devices and associated healthcare services. These programs can help individuals manage conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease more effectively while reducing the need for frequent office visits and hospitalizations.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Artificial Intelligence and Personalized Healthcare</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">Artificial intelligence is being increasingly integrated into health insurance operations and healthcare delivery, providing more personalized and efficient services for consumers. AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants can help members navigate their benefits, find providers, and access care more easily, while predictive analytics can identify members who may benefit from specific interventions or programs.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Personalized medicine approaches that use genetic information, lifestyle data, and other individual characteristics to guide treatment decisions are becoming more widely covered by health insurance plans. These approaches can improve treatment effectiveness while reducing adverse effects and unnecessary treatments.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">AI-powered diagnostic tools and clinical decision support systems are being integrated into healthcare delivery to improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment recommendations. These tools can help healthcare providers identify potential health problems earlier and provide more targeted and effective treatments.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Regulatory Changes and Consumer Protections</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">The regulatory environment for health insurance has continued to evolve in 2025, with new consumer protections, enhanced oversight, and improved enforcement mechanisms that are designed to ensure that health insurance plans provide fair and adequate coverage to their members. These regulatory changes reflect ongoing efforts to balance consumer protection with market flexibility and innovation.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Enhanced Network Adequacy and Access Standards</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">Network adequacy standards have been strengthened to ensure that health insurance plans maintain sufficient numbers and types of healthcare providers to meet the needs of their members. These enhanced standards include specific requirements for geographic distribution of providers, appointment availability, and access to specialty care.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Surprise billing protections have been expanded to cover more types of healthcare services and situations, providing consumers with greater protection against unexpected out-of-network charges. These protections include requirements for advance notice of potential out-of-network charges and limits on the amounts that providers can charge for emergency and certain non-emergency services.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Appeals and grievance processes have been streamlined and enhanced to provide consumers with more effective mechanisms for challenging coverage decisions and resolving disputes with their health insurance plans. These improvements include shorter timeframes for appeals decisions, enhanced external review processes, and better communication requirements.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Data Privacy and Security Enhancements</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">Data privacy and security requirements for health insurance plans and healthcare providers have been significantly enhanced in response to growing concerns about the protection of personal health information. These requirements include stronger encryption standards, enhanced access controls, and more comprehensive breach notification requirements.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Consumer consent requirements for the use and sharing of health data have been strengthened, giving individuals more control over how their health information is used for purposes beyond their direct care. These requirements include opt-in consent for certain types of data sharing and enhanced transparency about how health data is used.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Cybersecurity standards for health insurance plans and healthcare providers have been enhanced to address evolving threats and vulnerabilities in the digital healthcare environment. These standards include requirements for regular security assessments, incident response planning, and employee training on data security best practices.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Impact on Different Population Groups</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">The health insurance changes occurring in 2025 are having different impacts on various population groups, with some changes providing particular benefits for specific demographics while others address longstanding disparities and access challenges. Understanding these differential impacts can help individuals and families better understand how the changes may affect their specific situations and coverage needs.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Young Adults and Families</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">Young adults and families with children are benefiting significantly from expanded preventive care coverage, enhanced mental health services, and improved pediatric care requirements. The expansion of telehealth services has been particularly valuable for busy families who may find it difficult to schedule and attend traditional office visits for routine care and minor health concerns.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Enhanced coverage for reproductive health services, including contraception, prenatal care, and fertility treatments, has provided young adults and families with better access to comprehensive reproductive healthcare. These improvements include coverage for a wider range of contraceptive methods and enhanced support for individuals experiencing fertility challenges.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Pediatric care requirements have been enhanced to include more comprehensive developmental screenings, mental health services for children and adolescents, and specialized care for children with complex medical needs. These improvements recognize the unique healthcare needs of children and the importance of early intervention and prevention in pediatric care.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Older Adults and Pre-Medicare Population</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">Older adults who are not yet eligible for Medicare are benefiting from enhanced coverage for age-related health screenings, chronic disease management programs, and services that support aging in place. These improvements include coverage for comprehensive geriatric assessments, fall prevention programs, and cognitive health screenings.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Long-term care planning and support services have been expanded to help older adults prepare for potential future care needs and access resources that can help them maintain their independence and quality of life. While comprehensive long-term care coverage remains limited, health insurance plans are increasingly covering services that can help prevent or delay the need for institutional care.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Prescription drug coverage improvements have been particularly beneficial for older adults who often take multiple medications and may face high out-of-pocket costs for necessary treatments. Enhanced coverage for generic medications, biosimilars, and patient assistance programs has helped reduce medication costs for many older adults.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Rural and Underserved Communities</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">Rural and underserved communities are experiencing significant benefits from the expansion of telehealth services, which can help address provider shortages and improve access to specialty care that may not be available locally. These services are particularly valuable for mental health care, chronic disease management, and specialty consultations that would otherwise require extensive travel.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Enhanced network adequacy requirements and provider access standards are helping to ensure that health insurance plans serving rural areas maintain adequate provider networks and reasonable access to care. These requirements include specific provisions for geographic distribution of providers and maximum travel distances for accessing care.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Mobile health services and community health programs have been expanded to reach underserved populations and provide care in non-traditional settings. These programs can include mobile clinics, community health fairs, and outreach programs that bring healthcare services directly to communities that may have limited access to traditional healthcare facilities.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Looking Ahead: Preparing for Continued Evolution</h2>

      <p className="mb-6">The health insurance landscape will continue to evolve beyond 2025, with ongoing technological innovations, policy developments, and changing consumer expectations driving further changes in how health insurance coverage is designed, delivered, and experienced. Understanding these trends and preparing for continued evolution can help consumers make informed decisions about their health insurance coverage and healthcare utilization.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Emerging Technologies and Treatment Approaches</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">Emerging technologies such as gene therapy, personalized medicine, and advanced diagnostic tools will continue to be integrated into health insurance coverage as they become more widely available and evidence-based. These technologies have the potential to provide more effective treatments for previously difficult-to-treat conditions while potentially reducing long-term healthcare costs through more targeted and effective interventions.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Artificial intelligence and machine learning will continue to be integrated into healthcare delivery and health insurance operations, providing more personalized and efficient services while potentially improving health outcomes and reducing costs. These technologies may enable more sophisticated risk assessment, personalized treatment recommendations, and proactive health management approaches.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Digital health platforms and virtual care delivery models will continue to evolve and expand, potentially providing more comprehensive and integrated approaches to healthcare that combine traditional medical care with digital tools, remote monitoring, and personalized health management programs.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Policy and Regulatory Developments</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">Health insurance policy and regulation will continue to evolve in response to changing healthcare needs, technological developments, and consumer expectations. Future policy developments may include further enhancements to consumer protections, expanded coverage requirements, and new approaches to healthcare financing and delivery.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Value-based care models that tie provider payments to health outcomes rather than volume of services will continue to expand, potentially leading to more coordinated and effective healthcare delivery while controlling costs. These models may influence how health insurance plans are designed and how they interact with healthcare providers.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Public health preparedness and response capabilities will continue to be enhanced in response to lessons learned from recent public health challenges, potentially including new coverage requirements for emergency preparedness, enhanced telehealth capabilities, and improved coordination between public health and healthcare delivery systems.</p>
