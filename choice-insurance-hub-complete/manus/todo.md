# Arcjet Security Implementation Todo List

## Configuration Tasks
- [x] Review current files and configuration
- [x] Verify Netlify build status and requirements
- [x] Confirm Netlify plugin configuration
- [x] Update next.config.js to enable API routes (removed `output: 'export'`)
- [x] Resolve dependency conflicts (date-fns version)
- [x] Install Arcjet dependencies (@arcjet/next, @arcjet/inspect)
- [x] Create and validate Arcjet API route

## Security Implementation
- [x] Implement bot detection (allowing search engines, blocking other bots)
- [x] Implement shield protection against common attacks (SQL injection, etc.)
- [x] Implement rate limiting using token bucket algorithm
- [x] Add spoofed bot detection for authenticated requests
- [ ] Add environment variable for ARCJET_KEY in Netlify settings
- [ ] Test API route in production environment
- [ ] Monitor security logs and adjust rules as needed

## Deployment Tasks
- [ ] Commit changes to repository
- [ ] Deploy to Netlify
- [ ] Verify API route is accessible in production
- [ ] Test security features with real traffic

## Documentation
- [ ] Document Arcjet security implementation
- [ ] Create usage guide for team members
- [ ] Document environment variable requirements
