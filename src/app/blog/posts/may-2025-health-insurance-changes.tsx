      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">3. Prescription Drug Cost Controls</h3>
      
      <p className="mb-6">The implementation of prescription drug pricing reforms has continued through 2025, bringing meaningful changes to how Americans pay for medications:</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">4. Mental Health Parity Enforcement</h3>
      
      <p className="mb-6">Mental health coverage has seen substantial improvements in 2025 due to strengthened enforcement of parity laws:</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">5. Value-Based Insurance Design Expansion</h3>
      
      <p className="mb-6">Value-based insurance design (VBID) continues to gain traction in 2025, with more plans adopting this approach:</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Navigating Your Health Insurance Options in 2025</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-6">With these significant changes to the health insurance landscape, here are some strategies to help you make informed decisions:</p>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">1. Reassess Your Coverage Needs Annually</h3>
      
      <p className="mb-6">Even if you're satisfied with your current plan, it's important to review your options each year:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">

      </ul>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">2. Understand Your Plan's Network</h3>
