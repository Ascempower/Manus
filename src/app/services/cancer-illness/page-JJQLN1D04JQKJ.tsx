        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          A diagnosis of cancer or another serious illness like a heart attack, stroke, or organ failure can be life-altering, bringing not only emotional distress but also significant financial challenges. Even with good health insurance, out-of-pocket costs for treatment, medications, travel for specialized care, and lost income can quickly become overwhelming.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Cancer and Catastrophic Illness Insurance plans are designed to provide a financial safety net during these difficult times. These policies typically pay a lump-sum cash benefit directly to you upon diagnosis of a covered illness. This benefit can be used however you need it most, offering flexibility when you face unexpected expenses.

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Cover Medical Expenses:</strong> Help pay for deductibles, copayments, out-of-network specialists, and treatments not fully covered by your primary health insurance.</li>
          <li><strong>Manage Non-Medical Costs:</strong> Use the funds for everyday living expenses, mortgage or rent payments, utility bills, childcare, or travel and lodging for treatment.</li>
          <li><strong>Replace Lost Income:</strong> If you or a caregiver needs to take time off work, the benefit can help compensate for lost wages.</li>
          <li><strong>Access Experimental Treatments:</strong> Provides funds that could be used for treatments or clinical trials not covered by standard insurance.</li>
          <li><strong>Reduce Financial Stress:</strong> Allows you and your family to focus on recovery and well-being rather than worrying about mounting bills.</li>
