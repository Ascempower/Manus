            <p>
              Health insurance is a type of insurance coverage that pays for medical, surgical, prescription drug, and sometimes dental expenses incurred by the insured. Health insurance can reimburse the insured for expenses incurred from illness or injury, or pay the care provider directly. It is crucial for protecting yourself and your family from potentially high medical costs and ensuring access to necessary healthcare services.
            </p>
            <p>
              Various types of health insurance plans are available, including Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) plans, Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plans, Exclusive Provider Organization (EPO) plans, and Point of Service (POS) plans. Each has different structures for networks, costs, and coverage.
