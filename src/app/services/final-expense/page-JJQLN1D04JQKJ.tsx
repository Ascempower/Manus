        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Final Expense Insurance, often referred to as burial insurance or funeral insurance, is a type of whole life insurance policy specifically designed to cover end-of-life expenses. These policies typically have smaller death benefits compared to traditional life insurance, ranging from a few thousand dollars up to $25,000 or $50,000, making them an affordable way to plan for these specific costs.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          The primary purpose of final expense insurance is to alleviate the financial burden on loved ones by providing funds for funeral and burial costs, outstanding medical bills, credit card debt, or other expenses that may arise after death. These policies often feature simplified underwriting, meaning they are easier to qualify for, even for seniors or individuals with some health conditions.
