            <p>
              Hospital Indemnity Insurance is a type of supplemental health insurance designed to provide extra financial protection when you are hospitalized. Even with comprehensive health insurance like Medicare or a private plan, a hospital stay can lead to significant out-of-pocket expenses. These can include deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and costs for services not fully covered by your primary insurance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike traditional health insurance that pays healthcare providers directly for specific medical services, Hospital Indemnity Plans pay a fixed cash benefit directly to you for each day you are confined to a hospital, or as a lump sum for a covered hospital stay. This money can be used however you see fit â€“ to cover medical bills, transportation, childcare, lost income, or any other expenses incurred during your recovery.
