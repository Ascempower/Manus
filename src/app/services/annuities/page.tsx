        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          An annuity is a long-term investment product issued by an insurance company, designed to help protect you from outliving your money. You make a lump-sum payment or a series of payments, and in return, the insurer agrees to make periodic payments to you, either immediately or at some point in the future. Annuities can provide a reliable stream of income during retirement, supplementing other sources like Social Security and pensions.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          There are several types of annuities, including fixed, variable, and indexed annuities, each with different features, risk levels, and potential returns. Understanding these differences is key to choosing an annuity that aligns with your retirement goals.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Fixed annuities offer a guaranteed interest rate for a specific period. This means your principal investment is protected, and you know exactly how much your annuity will earn. They are generally considered a conservative option, suitable for individuals seeking predictable income and capital preservation.

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-2">Indexed Annuities (Fixed Indexed Annuities)</h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Indexed annuities, also known as fixed indexed annuities (FIAs), offer the potential for higher returns based on the performance of a specific market index (like the S&P 500), while still providing a level of protection against market downturns. Your principal is typically protected from losses, but your upside potential may be capped or limited by participation rates. These can be a good option for those who want market-linked growth potential without direct market risk.

          <li><strong>Principal Protection:</strong> Fixed and indexed annuities can offer protection for your principal investment against market losses.</li>
          <li><strong>Death Benefits:</strong> Annuities often include a death benefit feature, allowing you to pass on remaining assets to your beneficiaries.</li>
