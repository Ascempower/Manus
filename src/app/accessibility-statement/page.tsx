      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-800">Measures to Support Accessibility</h2>
      <p>
        Choice Insurance Agency takes the following measures to ensure accessibility of our website:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> We incorporate accessibility into our website development and content creation processes.</li>
        <li><strong>Standards Compliance:</strong> We aim to conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA as our standard.</li>
        <li><strong>Design Considerations:</strong> We consider accessible design principles, including color contrast, keyboard navigation, and text alternatives for non-text content.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing:</strong> We periodically test our website for accessibility issues using a combination of automated tools and manual checks.</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback Mechanism:</strong> We provide ways for users to provide feedback on the accessibility of our website.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-800">Conformance Status</h2>
      <p>
        The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) define requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA. Choice Insurance Agency is partially conformant with WCAG 2.1 Level AA. Partially conformant means that some parts of the content do not fully conform to the accessibility standard.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we strive to adhere to the accepted guidelines and standards for accessibility and usability, it is not always possible to do so in all areas of the website. We are continually seeking out solutions that will bring all areas of the site up to the same level of overall web accessibility.
